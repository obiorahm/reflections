Reflect: Manual vs. Automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reasons why we make commits manually. 

We donot want Git to get changes committed by other people that may make our code break or just make everything confusing.
